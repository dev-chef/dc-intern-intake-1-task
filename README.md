# Task Definition

1. We need to build a simple booking system based on the prisma schema defined in ./prisma/schema.prisma. we have two main types of users in the system: Mentor & Mentee

Minimum Requirements

1. Mentor can add availabity slots.
2. Mentee can request to book a slot (slot booking is pending)
3. Mentor (Different Screen) can see booking requests for each slot
4. Mentor can Confirm / Cancel pending slot

Extra requirements

1. User authentication (you can use ready made auth solutions like Clerk)
2. Calendar view for solots
3. Mentor can change status of booking slot from Confirmed to Completed
4. Change from sqlite to a hosted database (ex: Postgres)
5. Deployment to Vercel

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
